In that problem, we should find a message that we already know using the algo genetic, the goal of that problem is to demonstrate the capability of the AG in finding a solution in a large set of possible solution. 
the individual is formed from the latin letters and its length is the length of the message that we shoulf find.

To test this problem, type : python main.py pop_size nb_generation proba

where : 
1 - pop_size : size of the population used in the algo gen
2 - nb_generation : the number of generations to be produced
3 - proba : mutation probability in the algo gen

Example: 
> python main.py 40 500 0.05
